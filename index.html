            <h3><i>Beta vulgaris</i></h3>   <!-- Botanical Name -->
            <p>
                All the vegetal sweetness of the beet, without the polarizing 
                earthiness—the brilliant Badger Flame is here to redeem 
                the beet's dirty reputation.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Boron deficiency can cause internal browning; 
                    confirm adequate boron levels with a soil test.

            <h4>Seeding</h4>   <!-- Seeding -->
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Sow seeds 1/2" deep well-worked soils, at least 55˚F. 
                    Can be seeded throughout the season until 8 weeks prior to 
                    hard frost.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sow seeds every 1”; thin seedlings to 3-4’’ apart 
                    depending on desired size.
                </li>
                <li>
                    5-8 days to emergence, slower in cold soil.

            </ul>   
            <h4>Transplanting</h4>   <!-- Transplanting -->
            <li>
                Start seeds indoors 5-7 weeks before last frost. 
                Sow seeds 1/2” deep. Optimal soil temperature for 
                germination: 85˚F.
            </li>
            <li>
                Start seeds every 2-3 weeks for continuous harvest 
                until 8 weeks before hard frost.
            </li>
            <li>
                Move transplants outdoors to harden off gradually for 3-5 days, 
                protecting seedlings from wind, strong sun, hard rain and cold.
            </li> 
            <li>
                Transplant outdoors when soil temperatures reach at least 45˚F.

            <h3>Salt-Roasted Badger Flame Beets with Green Coriander and Ricotta</h3>
            <h4>By Renee Erickson (Seattle, WA)</h4>
            <!-- Ingredients: -->
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 teaspoon dijon mustard</li>
                <li>1 cup cilantro leaves, tightly packed</li>
                <li>1 cup flat-leaf parsley leaves, tightly packed</li>
                <li>1⁄4 cup fresh green coriander seeds or 2 tablespoons of toasted coriander seeds</li>
                <li>3⁄4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>1 clove garlic</li>
                <li>2 1⁄4 cup good quality white wine vinegar</li>
                <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 cup shelled unsalted pistachios</li>
                <li>1 box kosher salt</li>
                <li>10 badger flame beets, stems removed</li>
                <li>12 ounces fresh ricotta (preferably bellwether farms)</li>
                <li>cilantro flowers, for garnish (optional)</li>
                <li>maldon salt, for garnish </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Directions: -->
            <h4>Directions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Put the Dijon, cilantro, parsley, green coriander seeds, olive oil, 
                    garlic and 1⁄4 cup of the white wine vinegar into a blender and pulse to 
                    get it moving. Turn on high and blend until smooth. Add a touch of water if 
                    it’s too stiff to blend, but do not overmix. Season with salt and freshly 
                    ground black pepper to taste.
                </li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Toast the pistachios for about 10 minutes—they 
                    should still be chewy once cooled. Set aside.
                </li>
                <li>In a large bowl mix the entire box of kosher salt with the remaining white wine 
                    vinegar. Spread the wet salt on a baking sheet and place all but 1 beet on the salt. 
                    Cover tightly with aluminum foil, place in the oven and roast for 30-45 minutes 
                    (larger beets will take longer), until the beets are tender when pierced with a 
                    paring knife. Set aside to cool.
                </li>
                <li>Once cool, peel off the skins by rubbing them with your hands, 
                    then cut the beets into wedges.
                </li>
                <li>Peel the skin off the remaining uncooked beet and shave it on a mandolin into 
                    thin rounds. Salt the slices lightly and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>In a food processor, whip the ricotta on high for about 10 minutes, or 
                    until shiny and smooth.
                </li>
                <li>To serve, toss the roasted and sliced raw beets in a bowl with a drizzle of olive 
                    oil and a pinch of salt. Spread the ricotta onto a platter, leaving a well in 
                    the middle. Spoon some of the coriander vinaigrette into the well, followed by 
                    half the beets and half the pistachios. Repeat with more spoonfuls of the 
                    coriander vinaigrette and the rest of the beets and pistachios. Garnish with 
                    cilantro flowers and a sprinkle of Maldon salt.
                </li>
            </ol>
